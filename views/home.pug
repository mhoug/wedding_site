          p
            | Teresa and James have known each other for just about 12 years. James is a native of Detroit, Michigan and she 's a southern belle, born and raised in  Santee, South Carolina. They met each other on the wonderful college campus of the University of South Carolina Upstate. Total opposites in personality, James was rather popular.  Teresa on the other hand was very quiet and reserved.

            | As incoming freshman, they had several classes together. However, they never spoke to each other. It wasn't until taking a geography class together that they were forced to begin communicating. It was usually just a simple hi or bye in passing. This all changed when James needed to use Teresa's textbook as he had not yet purchased his. She told him that would be okay, and it did not hurt that she thought he was cute. Another plus was that he was very well versed on the subject and could help with her  with her class studies. It was an even trade off.

            | In the beginning James would meet Teresa to discuss the class material. Harmless, but as time passed they began to spend more time together. Studying turned into hanging out, going to the movies and dinner dates. Eventually they made it official. Around year 4 of their relationship things began to change for the worst. James had suffered the loss of someone very dear to him. He didn't quite know how to deal with death and instead of getting closer to Teresa, he chose to drift further and further away.

            | James graduated a semester earlier than Teresa did, resulting in him moving back to Michigan. They didn't keep in touch much after that. After Teresa completed her final semester of college she returned back home to Santee, South Carolina. 4 years have now passed and they both had been seeing other people and had pretty much moved on with their lives. There had been no communication between them this entire time. One night Teresa had a dream about him. She couldn't shake the feeling of not knowing if the person that she fell in love with in college was doing okay. She wrestled with the idea of reaching out, and eventually did just that. Not knowing if James' phone number was still the same, she mustered up enough courage to send a text message to the last phone number that she had for him. It read something to the affect of  “hi James, this is Teresa. I'm not even sure if this is still your telephone number, but I wanted to see how you were doing.” To her surprise it was him. He texted back immediately, saying how he had been thinking about me for some time, but was afraid to reach out. Needless to say, since that day they've never stopped communicating. We fell in love all over again and this time around there was a ring involved. Our story is a special one and I wouldn't change it for the world.
